# HangMan
HangMan created in Python! (Using graphics.py)

The reference code for this program was one of my past projects created in C++ 
but it only worked in console command and did not implement any graphics

This is why I decided to create a python version of the program with much more simpler
code , only requiring functions to work and with a graphical interface!

Next update the range of words will be varied and of different lenghts instead of 3.
Also there will be improvements to the background.

A possible feature to add difficulty is to make it a timed activity.

This code and reference code is created by Kelvin Rodriguez Puello, from PUPR
